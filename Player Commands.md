# JeriCraft Player Commands:

This list is periodically updated. If you find any errors or omissions, please contact a member of the staff team.

JeriCraft uses a hierarchy of ranks to organize players. The ranks are as follows:

- **Guest**: The default rank for all players. Guests have access to all basic commands, such
  as `/msg`, `/tpa`, `/warp`, etc.
- **Member**: The rank that players are promoted to after 1 month of playtime (or by joining our Discord Server).
  Members have access to all commands that Guests have access to, as well as some additional commands, such
  as `/setwarp`, `/hat`, `/sit`, etc.
- **Builder**: Builders have access World Edit and Creative mode (application required).
- **Squire** (donor rank) The rank players are promoted to after spending $1-$19 on our web store.
- **Titan** (donor rank) The rank players are promoted to after spending $20-$39 on our web store.
- **Mortal** (donor rank) The rank players are promoted to after spending $40-$59 on our web store.
- **Elder** (donor rank) The rank players are promoted to after spending $60+ on our web store.

Each rank has access to all commands of the ranks below it. For example, Members have access to all commands that
Guests have access to, and Squire has access to all commands that Members and Guests have access to.
